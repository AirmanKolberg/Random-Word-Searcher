# Random-Word-Searcher

This is an old shell script I found on a USB.  I thought it was entertaining, so I figured I'd share.
If you're looking for a way to have your machine continuously Google a word or words randomly over
and over again, this is the script for you.  It randomly selects whether it'll Google 1, 2, 3, or 4
words at random, then once it's picked the number of words, it Googles those random number of
random words for a random (ranged) amount of time, a time that is also displayed to you on the
Terminal emulator window whilst the Google results are being displayed.

## Requirements
- `counterMacOS11.sh`
- Access to a Terminal emulator
- A machine running Mac OS X or Mac OS 11 (note; if you have access to this, you also have access to
a Terminal emulator, so I really could have consolidated these two requirements into one)

NOTE-TO-SELF: Remove the second requirement, as well as everything within the parentheses of the third
and final requirement.

If you want this script (at all, for some reason) to run on Windows or Linux, you need only change lines
`37`, `55`, `75`, and `97`.

## Instructions
- Ensure the script is executable with a simple `chmod +x counterMacOS11.sh`
- Run the script with yet another simple `./counterMacOS11.sh`

It's as simple as that.  Now you're off to the races.  ü§ôüèº
